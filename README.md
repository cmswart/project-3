Requirements
For Project 3, you will work with your group to tell a story using data visualizations. Here are the specific requirements:


1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).


2. Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:


    -A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly


    -A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data


    -A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)




3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.


4. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.


5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).


6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
